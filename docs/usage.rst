Limitations and Issues
-----------------------

The following issues exist at the time of writing:

1. While the window can work at any aspect ratio and Grid Size, the window size is calculated at run-time.
Therefore, there will be distortions if the program changes to a different Grid Size. Though Functionality is unaltered.
